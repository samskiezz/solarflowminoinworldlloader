# Schism Event Transcript (in-universe)

> Internal debate between policy presets. Resolved by audit, not dominance.

## Context
A new doc discovery strategy is proposed.
- Option A (EFFICIENCY): aggressive compression, fewer checks.
- Option B (RESILIENCE): redundant verification, higher compute cost.

## Transcript
**LUMEN (Tier 3 / COLLAB):** The queue is growing. We need throughput.

**EFFICIENCY SECT (Operator chorus):**
- Reduce scoring dimensions.
- Fetch first, validate later.
- Accept controlled fragility.

**RESILIENCE SECT (SENTRY, Tier 2):**
- Fetching first is how noise becomes canon.
- Validation must be front-loaded.
- Evidence beats opinion.

**BOLT (Tier 2 / EXECUTION):** CI is green. We can afford guardrails. I propose bounded redundancy:
- pre-filter links by domain trust
- fetch only PDFs
- validate by model string + manufacturer match
- keep max batch small

**ATLAS (Tier 3 / OVERSEER):** Audit decision:
- Adopt RESILIENCE for discovery entry.
- Allow EFFICIENCY only after evidence score ≥ threshold.

## Outcome
**Canon patch:** “Redundancy at boundaries; compression inside verified lanes.”

Continuity preserved.
