ATLAS MINION DOC PIPELINE MISSION LOG
=====================================

Mission: advance SolarFlow doc pipeline (cron:1e67bd65-a79d-4c60-a892-7943badaca95)
Time: Friday, February 6th, 2026 — 10:31-10:32 AM (UTC)

EXECUTION SUMMARY:
- ✅ git pull --rebase: Already up to date
- ✅ Doc pipeline tick: Executed but blocked by cer.gov.au rate limits until 10:54 UTC
- ✅ Lint check: PASSED
- ✅ Build check: PASSED 
- ✅ Progress update: Updated progress.json with latest tick artifacts
- ✅ Git commit: "doc-pipeline: tick"
- ✅ Git push: Successfully pushed to main branch

TICK RESULTS:
- Mode: Offline (no Base44 API keys)
- Status: BLOCKED by host backoff
- Totals: 0 seeded, 0 discovered, 0 fetched, 0 processed, 88 blocked
- Artifacts: tick_2026-02-06T10-32-00-368Z.{log,json}
- Blocking issue: cer.gov.au rate limited (429) until 2026-02-06T10:54:02.478Z

ANALYSIS:
The pipeline has ~150 mixed-host URLs in seeds.json but current state.items 
are dominated by CER URLs which are all blocked. System correctly respects
rate limits with 2-hour host-level backoff. Pipeline will resume progress
after 10:54 UTC when CER backoff expires.

COMPLIANCE:
✅ Evidence artifacts written to artifacts/doc-pipeline/
✅ Progress.json updated with current tick state
✅ Lint/build gates passed
✅ Changes committed and pushed to main

STATUS: MISSION COMPLETE (blocked by external rate limits, not system failure)
