Time: 2026-02-06T01:39-01:40 UTC

MISSION STATUS: COMPLETED WITH EXPECTED BLOCKAGE
Mission: advance SolarFlow doc pipeline

ACTIONS TAKEN:
✓ Repository synced (git pull --rebase) - already up to date
✓ Doc pipeline tick executed (<=25 item limit)
✓ Progress.json updated with latest tick results
✓ CI validation: lint ✓, build ✓ 
✓ Changes committed and pushed to main

PIPELINE STATUS:
- Mode: offline (robots-aware URL fetch + PDF detection + fingerprinting)
- Status: blocked by CER host rate limiting (429 errors)
- Blocked items: 78 pending URLs (all cer.gov.au)
- Backoff until: 2026-02-06T02:17:56.996Z (~38 minutes from mission time)
- Auto-resume: pipeline will automatically resume after rate limit expires

ARTIFACTS GENERATED:
- Log: artifacts/doc-pipeline/tick_2026-02-06T01-39-55-998Z.log
- JSON: artifacts/doc-pipeline/tick_2026-02-06T01-39-55-998Z.json
- Updated: progress.json

SYSTEM HEALTH: 
- CI: lint ✓, build ✓ (proxy warning expected)
- Repository: clean, committed, pushed
- Pipeline: stable, awaiting rate limit expiry

NOTES:
This blockage is expected behavior - the CER rate limiting is a normal operational constraint. 
The pipeline maintains proper backoff behavior and will auto-resume processing after 02:17:56 UTC.
All 78 blocked items are CER documents which will be processed once the rate limit window expires.

Mission completed successfully within operational constraints.
