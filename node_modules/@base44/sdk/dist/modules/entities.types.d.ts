/**
 * Entities module for managing app data.
 *
 * This module provides dynamic access to all entities in the app.
 * Each entity gets a handler with full CRUD operations and additional utility methods.
 *
 * Entities are accessed dynamically using the pattern:
 * `base44.entities.EntityName.method()`
 *
 * This module is available to use with a client in all three authentication modes:
 *
 * - **Anonymous or User authentication** (`base44.entities`): Access is scoped to the current user's permissions. Anonymous users can only access public entities, while authenticated users can access entities they have permission to view or modify.
 * - **Service role authentication** (`base44.asServiceRole.entities`): Operations have elevated admin-level permissions. Can access all entities that the app's admin role has access to.
 *
 * ## Built-in User Entity
 *
 * Every app includes a built-in `User` entity that stores user account information. This entity has special security rules that can't be changed.
 *
 * Regular users can only read and update their own user record. With service role authentication, you can read, update, and delete any user. You can't create users using the entities module. Instead, use the functions of the {@link AuthModule | auth module} to invite or register new users.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Get all records from the MyEntity entity
 * // Get all records the current user has permissions to view
 * const myRecords = await base44.entities.MyEntity.list();
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // List all users (admin only)
